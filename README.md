# COMET tool-chain: CO-designing using Model-Driven Engineering for DaTaflow Applications

COMET tool-chain is developed in context of SENSATION project. The primary purpose of COMET tool-chain is HW-SW co-designing of dataflow applications, using Model-Driven Engineering. In particular, it has following ingredients.

1.	Utilising SDF3 for generating and analysing SDF graphs.
2.	Utilising EuGENia to develop GMF-based PAM Visual Editor for generating PAMs.
3.	Automatic transformation to UPPAAL CORA models.
4.	Utilising UPPAAL CORA for producing energy-optimal schedules for SDF graphs.

# Installation and Usage

Please refer to COMET_InstructionManual.pdf for instructions on installing and getting started with COMET tool-chain.
